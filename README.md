## Disclaimer (Jun 5 2020)
The development of this project was designed to fulfill a set of requirements outlined by a class criterion, and so we acknowledge that it is not the best solution for an actual scalable app. This was a very 'hacky' job so to speak and no design or implementation standards were established during the making of this project.

# RateMyLandlord
UBC CPSC 304 Final Project WT2 2019/20

Using:
 - NodeJS
 - MySQL
 - Express

# Setup

1. Install NodeJS
    - Version 12.16.1 or similar
2. Install MySQL
    - Version 8.0.19 or similar
    - Also get MySQL Workbench (provides nice GUI)
    - During set up, when it prompts you for a password DONT provide a password if possible (otherwise you might run into future errors, just press enter without putting in any password)
        - If you do run into errors, let me know because I also went through this. Otherwise, I just pasted in the error and followed what Google said
3. Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
    - This will be really helpful in writing our queries, as it will return the content of the calls made from our app to the database
4. Clone this repo into the directory you want to work in
    - `git clone <linkGivenByGithub>`
5. Run `npm install` in the project directory using your terminal/cmd line window
    - This will download the node packages that we need 
    - Run `npm install nodemon`
6. Open MySQLWorkbench
    - Connect to the local instance (should be named something like `user:root, localhost:3306`)
    - Run `CREATE DATABASE RateMyLandlord` in the query window 
    - Refresh the panel to make sure the database was created (in schemas tab)
7. Open the project in VSCode
    - open `server.js`
    - Make sure this is true for you:
    ``` 
    const db = mysql.createConnection({
    host     : 'localhost',
    user     : 'root',
    password : '',
    database : 'RateMyLandlord'
    }); 
    ```
8. In command line/terminal window:
    - Run `npm run start`
        - this will start the application
    - If it works, then you should see the application when you go to `localhost:3000` in your browser of choice
    
9. SASS (NEW! MARCH 30)
    - added script in package.json to convert our .scss to .css upon save. It will recompile anytime we change and save the .scss. This way, we should never be directly editing the .css files. 
    - run `npm install -g node-sass`
    - run `npm install -g concurrently --save-dev`

10. DATABASE INTERACTIONS SAMPLE (NEW! MARCH 30)
    - I added some files to show the base functionality of database interactions & how to use them in our .ejs files. Since it's not part of the project, you'll have to manually type `localhost:3000/samplePage` to test it out. For now, we can keep it in there so that you can see how it works/use the structure in future files.
        - `samplePage.ejs` The front end view. Has a form at the top, and will display the results from your table at the bottom. 
        - `routes\sampleRoute.js`. This is where we will define our page specific routes (so we don't crowd up the server.js). We should start to move our endpoints to this folder, and then import them as shown in `server.js`.
    - To test this out, you'll need to create a table in the database:
``` 
    CREATE TABLE testTable (
    ID int PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    firstName varchar(50),     
    lastName varchar(50) 
    );
 
    INSERT INTO testTable (firstName, lastName)
    VALUES ('jim','halpert');
    INSERT INTO testTable (firstName, lastName)
    VALUES ('michael','scott');
```
11. express session for login (NEW APRIL 4)
    - it seems that the easiest way to monitor user login is using sessions. I addded the import statements to server.js. All you have to do is install express with: 
        - `npm install express-session`

- The reason I added the AUTO_INCREMENT, is that it will assign and increment the PKs for us and we won't have to worry about adding a duplicate key by accident. 



# Architecture

Our front end components are in the "views" folder, as `.ejs` files.

# Practices
- It's good practice to run `npm install` after `git fetch` and `git pull` so that you have the same node packages as everyone else.
- Work off of feature branches, not master

## Random
- Upon saving `.ejs` files, the browser does not refresh the page manually so you'll have to hit refresh to view your changes... I'm not sure how to set up auto refresh at the moment
